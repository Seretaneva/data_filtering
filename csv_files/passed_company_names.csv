Gennem sport lærer man desuden at håndtere modgang, sætte sig mål og fejre succeser – kvaliteter der er værdifulde i både arbejdsliv og privatliv. Holdsport som fodbold, håndbold, basketball eller volleyball bygger på tæt samarbejde, kommunikation og en fælles strategisk forståelse. Alle spillere skal løfte i flok, og i mange klubber følger der en hel kultur med tilhørende traditioner, fanmiljøer og sammenhold. Både på professionelt og amatørniveau giver sport mennesker en følelse af at høre til et sted – uanset alder, køn og baggrund. Også inden for individuelle sportsgrene, såsom tennis, golf, atletik eller svømning, er der mulighed for et stærkt socialt fællesskab. Man træner sammen, deler erfaringer og støtter hinanden i jagten på bedre personlige rekorder.

It comprises the procedures organizations must undertake, the processes they must enable, and the technology that supports their efforts. Ensuring integrity, privacy, and security while enabling quality, availability, and usability of structured and unstructured data requires an effective decision-making process at the core of the enterprise's data governance program. The organization must make many choices in terms of investment prioritization, resource allocation, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to properly utilize data to advance business initiatives.
